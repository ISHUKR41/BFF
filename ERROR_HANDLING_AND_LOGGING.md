# Error Handling and Logging Guide

This guide provides comprehensive error handling and logging strategies for the BFF Gaming Tournament Platform.

## Backend Error Handling

### 1. Global Error Handler
The application implements a global error handler in `server/index-improved.ts` that:

- Captures all unhandled errors
- Logs detailed error information including timestamp, status, message, URL, method, user agent, and IP
- Provides different responses for server errors (500) vs client errors (4xx)
- Includes stack traces in development mode for debugging

### 2. Health Check Endpoint
The `/api/health` endpoint provides system status information:

- Database connection status
- Environment information
- Detailed error messages in development mode

### 3. Database Error Handling
The storage layer in `server/storage-improved.ts` includes:

- Try-catch blocks for all database operations
- Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Graceful degradation when possible

## Frontend Error Handling

### 1. API Error Handling
The frontend uses React Query for data fetching with built-in error handling:

- Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Error boundaries for component-level error handling
- User-friendly error messages with toast notifications

### 2. Form Validation
The registration form implements comprehensive validation:

- Zod schema validation for type safety
- Real-time validation feedback
- Proper error messaging for each field

## Logging Strategy

### 1. Backend Logging
The application uses a custom logging system:

- Structured logging with timestamps
- Different log levels (info, error, warn)
- Request/response logging with performance metrics
- Error logging with detailed context

### 2. Frontend Logging
The frontend implements:

- Console logging for development
- Error reporting to backend for production
- User action tracking for debugging

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Error Classification
Errors are classified as:

- **Client Errors (4xx)**: Invalid input, authentication failures, etc.
- **Server Errors (500)**: Database failures, unhandled exceptions, etc.
- **Network Errors**: Connection timeouts, DNS failures, etc.

### 2. Security Considerations
- Sensitive information is never logged
- Generic error messages for production to prevent information leakage
- Detailed error information only in development mode

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Request duration logging
- Database query performance tracking
- Memory usage monitoring

## Monitoring and Debugging

### 1. Vercel Logs
When deployed on Vercel, you can monitor:

- Function execution logs
- Cold start times
- Memory usage
- Error rates

### 2. Database Monitoring
- Query performance
- Connection pool usage
- Error rates

### 3. Client-Side Monitoring
- User interaction tracking
- Form submission success/failure rates
- Page load performance

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Database Connection Issues
- Check `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Verify database credentials
- Ensure database is accessible from the deployment environment

### 2. Authentication Failures
- Verify `JWT_SECRET` is correctly set
- Check token expiration settings
- Ensure session configuration is correct

### 3. Performance Issues
- Monitor function execution times
- Check database query performance
- Optimize data fetching patterns

### 4. Deployment Errors
- Review Vercel build logs
- Check environment variable configuration
- Verify file paths and dependencies

## Future Improvements

### 1. Advanced Monitoring
- Integration with monitoring services (e.g., Sentry, Datadog)
- Custom metrics and dashboards
- Alerting for critical errors

### 2. Enhanced Logging
- Structured JSON logging
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Retention policies for different log types

### 3. Automated Error Reporting
- Error reporting to external services
- Automated bug tracking
- User impact analysis

This comprehensive error handling and logging system ensures the BFF Gaming Tournament Platform is robust, maintainable, and provides a good user experience even when errors occur.
